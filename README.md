## Backend

### Running the Application
This is a Rails API-only application. Most responses require parameters to be passed either in the form of json or in the URL. Thus, it is recommended that the code be tested on Postman.

### Main Functionalities
Viewing the responses using a Json parser may be helpful. ```http://json.parser.online.fr/```

Default URL: http://localhost:3000/api/v1/
